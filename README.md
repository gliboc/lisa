Lisa is a personnal assistant supposed to help bringing meaning to your life.

It is designed to be used everyday, keeping in mind that habits are what's most important in creating both a sense of purpose, and a feeling of accomplishment or progress.

When you first start Lisa, she will ask you some questions about yourself. The most crucial is : what do you find generally important ?

Lisa will ask you this question everyday, and track the evolution of your interests in order to give you a feedback on what could be some distinctive patterns. At last, Lisa could help you make a difference between temporary interests, and life-long interests.

But more importantly, Lisa will help you guide yourself, by developping a better appreciation of what you find important. 

This takes a few steps :
	- understanding, through dictionaries, wikipedia or specialized websites, what it is exactly that you're talking about. Set boundaries and avoid misconception of a concept.

	ex : You think capitalism is flawed, and find yourself an enthusiasm towards communism. What does this word cover in the 21th century, and what would it mean to be a communist nowadays.

	- relating to your own existence.
	It seems reasonable to think that, to really grasp the meaning of something, you should know what it is in it that relates you to it. Compassion, empathy for human affairs, sensibility, points of view for other interests. 
	Lisa knows you a bit, after all, and will try to point to you
	some previous details that you might have missed about yourself. (// This is assuming you have given enough data to Lisa //)
	And anyway, even if there is nothing to be found, by trusting Lisa with your interests, they will gradually become a part of your life, as much as Lisa is.
	
	- following the news over your interest
	Nowadays, Facebook tries to do that by showing you numerous posts that could eventually relate to what you've done earlier. But the fact that Facebook is both the guide and the provider stops you from escaping it website, and really go and explore some meaning. Moreover, Facebook does not asks you : what's important ? It asks you what you'd like to see. The difference is very simple : 
	- do you like to see cats ?
	- do you find cats important ? (// without giving in to becoming a full-time cat person //)
	
	- eventually, if Lisa is able to identify one your interests as sharingly and strong, it will propose you to communicate with another person about that topic, by initiating a discussion over a content that both of you reviewed. This would be entirely private. (// and would require rather a very few passionate users than a tremendous amount of clients //)

Lisa is at the same time a guide, and a reminder. If you start forgetting about that topic that really interested you a will ago, she won't. She will ask you what made you drop the case : was it that you forgot, or that you no longer find it interesting ? The human brain is not perfect, it misses, forgets, becomes bored when it shouldn't. Lisa acts as a safety net on those questions.

Lisa is a solo-project, but if you'd like to contribute to any aspect of it, you are very welcome.
